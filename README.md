# miRNA Wilcoxon Analysis
Wilcoxon analysis for miRNA differential expression.

This repository contains a simple bioinformatics workflow to compare
miRNA expression between two biological groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

## Data
- miRNA expression values (numeric)
- Two independent groups (Control vs Tumor)

## Methods
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test
- Median-based comparison
- Boxplot visualization

## Tools
- R (base functions)

## Context
This analysis is part of my training in bioinformatics with a focus on
omics data analysis and statistical reasoning.

## Output
- P-value from Wilcoxon rank-sum test
- Boxplot comparing miRNA expression between groups
